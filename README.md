# Alloapp Assist

This is a "curl-able bash script" that initializes a new Alloverse
app for you in your current directory. Please read the

guide to understand how to use it.

In short:

```
$ mkdir myproj
$ cd myproj
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alloverse/alloapp-assist/master/setup.bash)"
...
$ ./allo/assist help
```
